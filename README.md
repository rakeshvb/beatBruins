You will be given a Bayesian network which may contain several decision nodes and a utility
node. There are two types of tasks:
1) Us e variable elimination or enumeration to calculate specific joint probabilities, marginal
probabilities, or conditional probabilities, when there is either no decision node, or the
decision node has a set value (for conditional probabilities). (~50%)
2) Calculate the expected utility or maximum expected utility, when there are one or more
unset decision nodes. (~50%)
